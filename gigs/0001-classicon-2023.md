ClassiCon 2023 Funding

What:
A small working group would like to push forward with plans for a Ethereum Classic conference.

We are hoping to put on a professional two-day event, with capacity for 200 people, live-streamed, and including an afterparty. The intended date is sometime in 2023 (venue availability ending). The conference itself will focus on high quality talks, workshops, and panel discussions. We will also build in some downtime for people to mingle, and enjoy conversation with peers and friends they may not have seen for some years.

We are imagining this will be the first of two funding requests.

This first tranche covers the total (maximum) estimated cost of putting on the event - €55,000.

The second tranche allocation will cover the cost of speaker and volunteer travel and accommodation. We imagine there will be 25 total speakers and volunteers, and we have a very rough estimate that the second fund will be around €25,000.

The idea is that the first tranche is the maximum cost for the event. As we get closer to the actual event, we should know how much we have saved from tranche 1 (i.e. the actual costs being less than the imagined maximum costings). Any funds that we have saved will be used to reduce the tranche 2 amount.

Please note that if the actual event costs are not significantly lower than the quoted maximum then the second tranche will be required to cover the total costs for speaker and volunteer travel and accommodation.

We also discussed the possibility of obtaining sponsors for the event. The decision was made to keep this an option, and to direct sponsors towards the second tranche (speaker, travel and volunteer costs). This way sponsors will hopefully have more certainty of the event happening, and they can ask speakers to note the support they have received from corporate donors. We will try and ensure that sponsors are not a requirement for event success, but if they can lessen the load on the community, that is also welcome.

The two tranche idea is mainly for two reasons:

To protect the community in the event of travel restrictions being imposed/or in the event that the event may be cancelled. The cost of travel is delayed until things are clearer/more certain.

Two tranches reduces the immediate burden on the community, by splitting the request into two smaller amounts.

Who:
I (random_alias) am one of the main instigators of this funding proposal - along with a number of other known and trusted community members. Personally, I have been a community member for a number of years, speaking at various events, conducting research, and constructively working on Ethereum Classic through (insert some organization). There is a core group who will be supporting organisation, planning, and overseeing the project throughout, including known and trusted members of the community.

How:
This is the important bit.

Firstly, I am proposing to hire two designated project managers to support organising the event. A PM was also hired for Classic Con 2022 (so there is precedent).

I am personally nominating (and taking ultimate responsibility for) two entities known and trusted to me. They own and operate (xxxxx) Events, and have recently successfully put on (cited conference) conference in Lisbon, in October 2021). They also have experience at putting on cryptocurrency/blockchain conferences in Ireland, Japan, and Korea.

A series of photos from their events may be found here.

Why:
To ensure we have a Classic Con 2023 the fosters protocol development on top the Ethereum Classic Network with a goal of increased network usage and adoption.

Amount:
xxx ETC

Pandemic fallback:
Due to this ongoing issue, we will need to have a plan in place to mitigate potential eventualities where the event has to be cancelled. We are not envisaging this for an event of 200 people. However, we will organise to have a refund agreement in place with all venues/service providers, and also for anybody that has pre-purchased tickets. We will also be reticent of travel and accommodation refunds that may be forthcoming. Obviously this won’t be possible for everything - but hopefully will be for most things. Any surplus ETC raised and not spent in this eventuality will flow back to the General Fund to be used for ClassiCon 2024 (if not cancelled as well).

The ETCDAO does not afford refunds to be paid to donors. To this effect, if the proposal is funded and the event has to be cancelled/postponed all ETC will be directed towards ClassiCon 2024. If the proposal is only partially funded - all raised ETC will be directed to the ClassiCon 2024 fund

(Note: This is an example proposal ripped from the Monero CSS as an example proposal that could be an annual event.)
